The scope of this project aims to create modern GUI entry form, where all of it's elements and reference conditions are controlled from an excel spreadsheet.
This is intended for non-coders to be able to mainpulate form elements and set specific reference values/parameters for immediate feedback from the form.
The project includes just the python project and not the parameter sheet for privacy purposes.
The project is organized into one main file, which contains the main elements that are generated at the initialization step.
All other modules contain functions for how each widget works together, and depedent widget creation.
